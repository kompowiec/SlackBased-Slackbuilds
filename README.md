# SlackBased-Slackbuilds
Unofficial or otherwise unsupported Slacking.
This is a place for all and any new slackbuild/slackware projects that otherwise couldn't be included in the official slackbuild website. Everybody is welcome to contribute and develop, we all must strive to achieve Slack in Bob Dobbs name. Have Fun!
